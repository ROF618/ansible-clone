# ansible-clone

This Python script will create an Ansible playbook that duplicates an existing system. The idea is that once you have a system configured the way you like it, you just run this tool and it will create a playbook that you can use to configure another system in the same way.

This is something I've wanted for a long time. Be warned though, it's a very rough work in progress.
